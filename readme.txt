== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will WP Content Copy Protection Plugin have a negative impact on my SEO? =

Absolutely not! This plugin will only affect the client browser and will have absolutely no negative impact on your SEO. In fact, it would assist in increasing your SEO score as your content will remain unique.

= Will this plugin disable the features from the site administrator also? =

Yes! However, our Pro version allows the blog administrator to enable/disable copy protect functions for registered and logged in users (globally)

= Will your WP Content Copy Protection Plugin affect my Advertising Units (Adsense)? =

Absolutely not! Although this plugin locks your content and prevents it from being copied by anyone else, your advertising units will remain unaffected as the code doesn't alter any embeddable code or the functioning thereof.

= Why Did you Exclude The alert-message (Popup), Function? =

This function was removed simply because it could scare away your website visitors - cause a higher bounce rate - and essentially defame your website. We like to be silent! However, this is optional in our Pro edition.

= Does your Plugin work on all major Browsers? =

This plugin works on all major browsers and theme frameworks. The full functionality of WPCCP was tested on the latest versions of IE (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Chrome without any problems.

= What is the difference between the free version and the pro version? =

The pro version includes super aggressive image protection (making it near impossible for a user to copy/steal your images using advanced masking), Prt Sc (print screen) deterrent agent, optional alert message for right click, Javascript validation with idle redirect, removed all RSS feeds instances to counter content scraping software/autoblogs and much, much more! See our features above.

= Why did you remove the iframe breaker? =

We decided to remove the Iframe breaker due to conflict with theme appearance/customization.

= How would I break out of Iframes now? =

We have developed a small plugin that will act as an extension to WP Content Copy Protection. This plugin, WP noFrame/noClickjacking can be found [HERE](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-noframenoclickjacking/). This plugin is a simple (yet) effective frame breaking plugin (iframe buster) that protects your site content from being embedded into other sites - effectively defending you against clickjacking attacks. This is achieved by adding a Header always append X-Frame-Options DENY instruction to your .htaccess file - where the DENY rule will prevent ALL domains from framing your content.

= How is my Video and Audio Protected? =

This plugin inheritently disables right click/copy/save functions on your default HTML5 video and audio embeds.
