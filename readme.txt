== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will WP Content Copy Protection Plugin have a negative impact on my SEO? =

Absolutely not! This plugin will only affect the client browser and will have absolutely no negative impact on your SEO. In fact, it would assist in increasing your SEO score as your content will remain unique.

= Will this plugin disable the features for the site administrator also? =

Yes! However, you can disable the features for site administrators and registered users. With the Pro version you can also disable the features for different roles.

= Will your WP Content Copy Protection Plugin affect my Advertising Units (Adsense)? =

Absolutely not! Although this plugin locks your content and prevents it from being copied by anyone else, your advertising units will remain unaffected as the code doesn't alter any embeddable code or the functioning thereof.

= Why Did you add The alert-message (Popup), Function? =

The message is optional and can be excluded. Many a times user might need to be told that right click has been disabled. The message can now be customized as well.

= Does your Plugin work on all major Browsers? =

This plugin works on all major browsers and theme frameworks. The full functionality of WPCCP was tested on the latest versions of IE (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Chrome without any problems. Although, there might be some issues with mobile browsers such as Opera Mini and UC Browsers.

= What is the difference between the free version and the pro version? =

The pro version includes super aggressive image protection (making it near impossible for a user to copy/steal your images using advanced masking), Prt Sc (print screen) deterrent agent, optional alert message for right click, Javascript validation with idle redirect, removed all RSS feeds instances to counter content scraping software/autoblogs and much, much more! See our features above.
